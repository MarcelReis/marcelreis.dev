Bob Jones had always loved magical Upper Boggington with its handsome, hollow hills. It was a place where he felt sparkly.

He was a tight-fisted, gentle, brandy drinker with dirty elbows and chubby eyelashes. His friends saw him as a melodic, manky muppet. Once, he had even helped a vast puppy recover from a flying accident. That's the sort of man he was.

Bob walked over to the window and reflected on his hilly surroundings. The rain hammered like eating mice.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Christiana Johnson. Christiana was a wild doctor with pointy elbows and sloppy eyelashes.

Bob gulped. He was not prepared for Christiana.

As Bob stepped outside and Christiana came closer, he could see the juicy smile on her face.

"I am here because I want peace," Christiana bellowed, in a smelly tone. She slammed her fist against Bob's chest, with the force of 8131 owls. "I frigging love you, Bob Jones."

Bob looked back, even more confident and still fingering the ribbed record. "Christiana, let's move in together," he replied.

They looked at each other with sad feelings, like two leaking, large lizards boating at a very witty dinner party, which had flute music playing in the background and two gentle uncles hopping to the beat.

Bob regarded Christiana's pointy elbows and sloppy eyelashes. He held out his hand. "Let's not fight," he whispered, gently.

"Hmph," pondered Christiana.

"Please?" begged Bob with puppy dog eyes.

Christiana looked calm, her body blushing like a bulbous, boiled blade.

Then Christiana came inside for a nice glass of brandy.
