Georgina Gobble was thinking about Heather Barker again. Heather was a creepy do gooder with tall legs and fluffy lips.

Georgina walked over to the window and reflected on her derelict surroundings. She had always loved pretty Falmouth with its bad, bright beaches. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel sparkly.

Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a creepy figure of Heather Barker.

Georgina gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a vile, sinister, squash drinker with spiky legs and charming lips. Her friends saw her as an expensive, embarrassed elephant. Once, she had even revived a dying, toddler.

But not even a vile person who had once revived a dying, toddler, was prepared for what Heather had in store today.

The sleet rained like loving giraffes, making Georgina puzzled. Georgina grabbed a spotty knife that had been strewn nearby; she massaged it with her fingers.

As Georgina stepped outside and Heather came closer, she could see the kindly glint in her eye.

"I am here because I want some more Twitter followers," Heather bellowed, in a helpful tone. She slammed her fist against Georgina's chest, with the force of 4614 pigeons. "I frigging love you, Georgina Gobble."

Georgina looked back, even more puzzled and still fingering the spotty knife. "Heather, let's get married," she replied.

They looked at each other with delighted feelings, like two sweet, squiggled snakes loving at a very hopeful rave, which had indie music playing in the background and two cowardly uncles bopping to the beat.

Suddenly, Heather lunged forward and tried to punch Georgina in the face. Quickly, Georgina grabbed the spotty knife and brought it down on Heather's skull.

Heather's tall legs trembled and her fluffy lips wobbled. She looked healthy, her body raw like a tame, thundering torch.

Then she let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Heather Barker was dead.

Georgina Gobble went back inside and made herself a nice beaker of squash.
